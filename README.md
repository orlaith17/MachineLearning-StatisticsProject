# Machine Learning and Statistics Project repository

### Machine Learning and Statistics 2021 GMIT
### Orla Higgins G00364860
##

The purposes of this repository is to provide an overview of the scipy.stats scikit-learn libraries in Python.  

### Quick Steps
##

You can view the notebook in static form by clicking the following image:

## How to run the notebook

1. Download [Anaconda]().
2. Download [cmder]() if on Windows.
3. Run `jupyter lab`. 



GitHub Repository Overview
This repository stores the relevant files and instructions for the Final Assesment Project for the Machine Learning and Statistics Module for the HIGHER DIPLOMA IN SCIENCE IN COMPUTING (DATA ANALYTICS) through GMIT.

The aim of this project, as described in assessment.pdf, is to provide a detailed description of the Python Packages scikit-learn and scipy.stats, an overview of how the modules are used within the paradigm of machine learning and statistics, each modules distinct features and practical demonstrations of the use of these modules.

The scikit-learn notebook focuses on 3 distinct machine learning algorithms, while the scipy.stats notebook looks at performing an ANOVA analysis using methods available within that python module.

Each module has its own jupyter notebook .ipybn file which contain all the python code and descriptions written in markdown. Those files can be found in the notebooks folder.

Running the code
Run Locally
To run the notebook on your machine you will need to have Juptyer installed. If you have the anaconda distribution you should already have Jupyter installed. If not running anaconda and you have pip installed you can download Jupyter using the pip install command in the command line like below.

pip install jupyter

Now that you have Jupyter installed, you can download the notebook. To launch the notebook app navigate to the directory the file is stored in on the command line and enter the jupyter notebook command as below:

jupyter notebook

The jupyter notebook app should launch in your browser and should contain the contents of the directory you were in. Simply select either of the .ipynb notebook files to open in the browser.

This notebook is designed to be executed from start to finish. All code cells build on previous cells within the notebook and variables are called from previous cells. If you receive an unexpected error codes make sure that the code has been run in order. Code can be run using the keyboard shortcut Shift + Enter.

Dependencies
If running the notebooks on your machine, your will need a version of python installed. The notebooks were created and tested using Python version 3.8.3, but may work with other versions. All package dependencies are listed in the requirements.txt file. To install all packages you can use the below command from within the project directory that contains the requirements.txt file.

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run Remotely
If you do not wish to run the notebooks on your machine you can use either the NB Viewer or the Binder links below. NB viewer allows for view only access to the notebook from within the browser while Binder allows you to execute the code cells remotely from the browser.

This eliminates the need to install any further software or packages on your machine.
